# HIGHER OR LOWER AI
In this project we implement the Higher or Lower game and create two AIs for it.

The AIs are created using the Jenetics package. For easy access, use Maven together with the included pom
file.

### Game description
The Higher or Lower game is a game where, given an interval, 
the player should guess a specific random number in that interval.
When the player makes a guess they get to know if their guess is 
higher or lower than the given number. The player succeeds at the game once they guess the correct number.
