# HIGHER OR LOWER AI
In this project we implement the Higher or Lower game and create two AIs for it.
Inspired by open AIs Hotter-colder problem 

The AIs are created using the Jenetics package. For easy access, use Maven together with the included pom
file.

**Update:**  
I've added two neural network AIs which uses the deeplearning4j packages.  
The code is very badly structured since it's mostly me experimenting with how it works.

### Game description
The Higher or Lower game is a game where, given an interval, 
the player should guess a specific random number in that interval.
When the player makes a guess they get to know if their guess is 
higher or lower than the given number. The player succeeds at the game once they guess the correct number.
